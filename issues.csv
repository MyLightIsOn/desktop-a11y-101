"Create lessons hub and Lesson 1 (Basics)","Build the lessons hub page linking to all 5 lessons, and Lesson 1 covering screen reader basics (reading, navigation, stop speech).","Hub lists all 5 lessons; Lesson 1 is keyboard navigable; practice area works with arrow key reading; both NVDA and VoiceOver shortcuts displayed."
"Create Lesson 2 (Headings Navigation)","Build Lesson 2 teaching heading navigation using H key (NVDA) and VO+Cmd+H (VoiceOver) with a practice area of nested headings.","Lesson explains heading navigation clearly; practice area has proper heading hierarchy; screen reader can jump between headings."
"Create Lesson 3 (Browse vs Focus Mode)","Build Lesson 3 teaching the distinction between browse mode (reading) and focus mode (interacting) with Enter/Escape transitions.","Lesson clearly explains browse vs focus mode; practice area demonstrates mode transitions; Enter and Escape keys work correctly."
"Create Lesson 4 (Quick Navigation)","Build Lesson 4 teaching Tab key, landmark navigation (D key), and element lists (Insert+F7 / VO+U rotor).","Lesson explains Tab, landmarks, and element lists; practice area has proper landmark structure; element list navigation works."
"Create Lesson 5 (Forms and Tables)","Build Lesson 5 teaching form field and table navigation with practice form and table elements.","Practice form announces labels correctly; practice table navigable with T key and arrow keys; table headers announce properly."

"Create puzzle grid (start page)","Build the start page displaying 6 puzzle room cards in a grid layout with Puzzle 6 locked until puzzles 1-5 are complete.","Grid displays 6 puzzle cards; each card is keyboard accessible; Puzzle 6 locked until prerequisites met; screen reader announces lock status."
"Create Puzzle 1 - The Dusty Attic (Headings)","Build Puzzle 1 teaching heading navigation in a dark attic setting. Solution hidden from visual users, only findable via H key.","Puzzle solvable only by heading navigation; hidden elements not visually discoverable; timer tracks time; completion saves to localStorage."
"Create Puzzle 2 - The Mysterious Library (Browse/Focus)","Build Puzzle 2 teaching browse vs focus mode in an ancient library. Requires understanding mode switching to find the solution.","Puzzle requires browse vs focus mode understanding; Enter key switches modes properly; completion saves to localStorage."
"Create Puzzle 3 - The Winding Corridors (Landmarks)","Build Puzzle 3 teaching landmark navigation in maze-like hallways. Solution hidden within a specific landmark region.","Multiple landmarks accessible via D key and VO+U; correct landmark contains the solution; puzzle solvable by landmark jumping."
"Create Puzzle 4 - The Grand Foyer (Element Lists)","Build Puzzle 4 teaching element list navigation in an ornate entrance hall. Correct link findable via element list only.","Many links present on page; element list reveals the correct link; puzzle solvable via element list navigation."
"Create Puzzle 5 - The Alchemist's Laboratory (Forms/Tables)","Build Puzzle 5 teaching form and table navigation in a dark laboratory. Form fields hidden within table cells.","Table navigable with T key and arrow keys; table headers announce properly; form submission triggers completion."
"Create Puzzle 6 - The Haunted Ballroom (Combined)","Build Puzzle 6 as the final challenge combining all 5 previously learned skills in a multi-step puzzle.","Puzzle requires all 5 previous skills; multi-step progression feels natural; only unlocks after puzzles 1-5 complete."
