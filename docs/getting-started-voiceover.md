# Getting Started with VoiceOver (Mac)

VoiceOver is Apple's built-in screen reader and comes pre-installed on all company MacBooks — no installation needed.

## Step 1: Enable VoiceOver

Press **Cmd + F5** to toggle VoiceOver on or off.

You can also enable it via: **System Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver**

VoiceOver will begin speaking immediately when turned on.

## Step 2: Complete the VoiceOver Tutorial

Before using Mystery House, complete the built-in macOS VoiceOver Tutorial. It covers the essential skills you'll need.

To launch the tutorial:
1. Enable VoiceOver (Cmd + F5)
2. When prompted, choose **"Start the VoiceOver Tutorial"**
3. If the prompt doesn't appear, open **VoiceOver Utility** (VO + F8) → Help → Open VoiceOver Tutorial

## Key Concepts

- **VO Keys:** VoiceOver uses **Control + Option** as its modifier key, abbreviated as **VO** throughout this guide.
- **VO Cursor:** VoiceOver navigates using its own cursor, separate from the keyboard focus.
- **Rotor:** Press **VO + U** to open the Rotor — a menu for quickly navigating by headings, links, landmarks, and more.

## Recommended Browser

Use **Safari** for the best VoiceOver experience. Safari has the deepest integration with macOS accessibility features.
