Before using Mystery House, work through these two tutorials from the American Foundation for the Blind:

1. [Hotkeys and Commands, Part 1](https://afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-videos/learn-nvda/hotkeys-and) — covers essential NVDA keys and navigation commands

## Key Concepts

- **NVDA Key:** The **Insert** key is your main modifier key, abbreviated as **NVDA** throughout this guide.
- **Browse Mode:** For reading web content — arrow keys move through content, and single-letter shortcuts (H, D, T) are active.
- **Focus Mode:** For interacting with forms and buttons — keys go directly to the element rather than acting as shortcuts. NVDA switches modes automatically in most cases.

## Recommended Browser

Use **Mozilla Firefox** for the best NVDA experience. Firefox has the strongest compatibility with NVDA's accessibility features.
